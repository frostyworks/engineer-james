 Discord bot written in python that interacts with open notify API (http://api.open-notify.org/) to retrieve some data from space

# Usage
!astronauts command retrieves data in json format about current astronauts in space.
!location command retrieves data in json format (latitude, longitude).

 # Contribute
 Feel free to fork the project and make pull requests. As for now, there is nothing much to do with open notify API.
